# Getting started

You'll need a working MacOS development environment with XCode 10 to use this
template. You can find instructions to get up and running on the Apple [XCode website](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

If you want to use GitLab CI with your own MacOS runners (a requirement since we
do not currently yet offer shared MacOS runners - follow [infrastructure#5294](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/issues/5294) for
updates on that front) please read through the blog post above which will walk 
you through everything you need to get up and running.
