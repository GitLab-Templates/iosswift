# Introduction

This is a template for getting started with iOS development using GitLab and [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/).

# Getting started

You'll need a working MacOS development environment with XCode 10 to use this
template. You can find instructions to get up and running on the Apple [XCode website](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

If you want to use GitLab CI with your own MacOS runners (a requirement since we
do not currently offer shared MacOS runners), please read through the blog 
post above which will walk you through a working production configuration using
this approach.
